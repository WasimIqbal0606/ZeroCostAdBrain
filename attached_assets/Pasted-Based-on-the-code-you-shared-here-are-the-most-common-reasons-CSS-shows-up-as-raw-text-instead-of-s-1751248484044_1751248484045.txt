Based on the code you shared, here are the most common reasons CSS shows up as raw text instead of styling your page—and how to check each:

1. Style block not wrapped in <style> tags or missing type attribute

What to check: Ensure your CSS is enclosed between <style> and </style> (when embedded in HTML) and, if your document is XHTML, that you include type="text/css".

Example:

<head>
  <style type="text/css">
    /* your CSS here */
  </style>
</head>

Symptom: If you omit <style> tags or place CSS outside them, browsers render it as plain text.

2. CSS file not properly linked (wrong path or missing rel)

What to check: In your <head>, confirm you have a <link> tag pointing to your stylesheet with the correct path and filename:

<link rel="stylesheet" href="/static/css/style.css">

Symptom: A typo in href or forgetting rel="stylesheet" causes the CSS file to be treated as content rather than applied styles.

3. MIME type misconfiguration on server

What to check: When your server serves .css files, it must send Content-Type: text/css headers. If it sends text/plain, the browser will display the CSS text instead of parsing it.

How to test: Open DevTools → Network tab → reload page → click your CSS file → check the Response Headers.

4. CSS output inside a <pre> or code container

What to check: Make sure you’re not accidentally printing CSS within a <pre>, <code>, or other tag that forces literal text rendering.

Symptom: The CSS appears styled like code blocks rather than affecting page styles.

5. Streamlit-specific quirks (if using Streamlit)

What to check: When using st.markdown(...) to inject CSS, you must pass unsafe_allow_html=True. Otherwise, Markdown will escape your <style> tags and show them as text.

Example:

st.markdown(
  """
  <style>
    /* your CSS */
  </style>
  """,
  unsafe_allow_html=True
)

Next steps: Please share your HTML <head> section (with your <link> and/or <style> tags) and the server console or DevTools Network/Console errors you’re seeing. With the exact <head> snippet and any error messages, I can pinpoint which of these issues is affecting your setup.
